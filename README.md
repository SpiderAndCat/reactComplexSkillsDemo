# reactComplexSkillsDemo
This repo showcases, through an interactive ToDo web app, my understanding of more complex React skills:
- **Complex State** (nested JS objects and arrays),
- **Destructuring** (Arrays, Objects, and nested Arrays and Objects),
- **Controlled Components** (reflecting state across components),
- **Event Handling** (across components)

 ***Access the live demo*** here: (WIP)
